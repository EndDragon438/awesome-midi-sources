# Contribution Guidelines

These are the guidelines for contributing to [Awesome MIDI sources](https://github.com/albertmeronyo/awesome-midi-sources)

## Non-working Links
If you find a link that isn't working anymore, instead of removing it please move it to the end of its section as a comment. In markdown you do this by

```md
[comment]: <> (http://example.org/ Example site -- hmm this doesn't seem to work anymore)
```

Leave a blank line before comments, since some markdown parsers seem to have trouble otherwise.
